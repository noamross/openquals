[Forest Landscape Pathology][1]
===============================

**Examiner: [David Rizzo]**

[Landscape-level disease management][1]
---------------------------------------

Several papers on the landscape-scale approach to forest disease:

-   @Gilbert1996
-   @Hansen2000
-   @Holdenrieder2004
-   @Meentemeyer2012

Case studies in forest from @Tainter1996. For each of these, read 1-2 refs to
understand the relationships between tree-, stand-, and landscape-level
processes, and how management approaches to the disease reflect these processes.
How do the disease, ecosystem properties, and social context affect the efficacy
of approaches such as resistance breeding, silvicultural treatment, eradication,
spread-slowing?:

-   Root system decay 
-   Needle Blight
-     blister and fusifirm rust
-   Dwarf mistletoe

Do the same for insects from our [forest outbreaks seminar]

-   Gypsy Moth
-   Bark beetles

[Sudden Oak Death][1]
---------------------

In addition to ecological papers by [David Rizzo] about Sudden Oak Death
ecology, papers and reviews on the biology of the organism:

-   @Rizzo2005
-   @Grunwald2012
-   @Swiecki2013
-   @Ellison2010

[Model Construction and Theory][1]
==================================

**Examiner: [Marissa Baskett]**

[Approaches to building and using models][1]
--------------------------------------------

Philosophical underpinnings of ecological models, how to go about designing your
model, and interfacing with non-modeling fields

-   @Levins1966
-   @Aber1997
-   @May2004
-   Steve Pacala's MacArthur Lecture (2011, unpublished)

[SIR epidemiological models][1]
-------------------------------

Basic epidemiological theory, the importance of *R*~0~, and its interpretation
and derivation in increasingly complex model structures

-   @Kermack1927
-   @Kermack1932
-   @Kermack1933
-   @Anderson1991

[Population structure in disease dynamics][1]
---------------------------------------------

The role of intra- and inter-specific variation in disease transmission

-   A general overview: @Tuljapurkar2012
-   The WAIFW framework and age-structured populations
    -   Theoretical foundation: @Anderson1985
    -   Empirical examples: @Dwyer1997, @Metcalf2011

-   Dynamics of pathogens with multiple hosts
    -   Theoretical treatments @Holt2003, @Dobson2004,
    -   Empirical examples: @Klepac2009, @Craft2008

-   Host spatial structure and clustering: @Park2002, @Brown2004a
    -   Other consequences of age structure on populations
    -   Transient dynamics: @Ezard2010, @Caswell2005
    -   Modification of rate of spread: @Bosch1990
    -   Applications: @White2012c

For reference, see Diekman's 2000 and 2012 book on mathematical epidemiology.

[Plant-specific applications][1]
--------------------------------

Models that inform my own. What is different, from a theoretical perspecticve,
in plant/forest systems compared to animal systems?

-   Yellow dwarf virus: @Borer2007, @Moore2011a, @Seabloom2009
-   Pollinator-borne anther smut: @Ferrari2006
-   Other examples from @Gilligan2008

[Confronting Models with Data][1]
=================================

**Examiner: [Andrew Latimer]**

[Fitting time-series data with iterative filtering][1]
------------------------------------------------------

How to estimate likelihood and maximum-likelihood parameters for dynamic
ecological models, using multivariate time-series data?

-   @Andrieu2002
-   @Gimenez2012
-   @Arulampalam2002
-   @Ionides2006
-   @He2010
-   @Knape2012

[Model Comparison][1]
---------------------

How do we compare and/or average models to select the best one for purposes of
prediction and illuminating mechanisms?

-   @Friedman2001, Chapter 7
-   @Gelfand1998
-   @Spiegelhalter2002
-   Accounting for uncertainty: @Cressie2009


[Natural Resource Economics][1]
===============================

Examiner: [Jim Sanchirico]

[Forest rotation models][1]
---------------------------

Optimal management of timber forests under rotation, with ecosystem service
values, and under stochastic risk. How do traditional models of fire apply to
disease?

-   Forest rotation: @Faustmann1849 and @Reed1986
-   Stochastic fire risk: @Reed1984 
-   Ecosystem service value: @Hartman1976

[Age-structured harvest models][1]
----------------------------------

What are the differences and relative advantages of stand- and invidual-based
forestry models?

-   @Tahvonen2004; @Tahvonen2009; Tahvonen2011

[Insect control][1]
-------------------

How do recent models of insect control apply to airborne diseases like SOD?

Gypsy Moth:

-   @Bogich2008
-   @Blackwood2012
-   @Epanchin2012

Mountain Pine Beetle:

-   @Sims2010
-   @Sims2011
-   @Aadland2012
