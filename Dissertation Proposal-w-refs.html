<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>Forest disease spreads through plant communities structured by species composition, age distribution, and spatial arrangement. I propose to examine the consequences of the interaction of these components of population structure on a model systems of <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em> invasion in California redwood forests. First, I will compare the dynamic behavior of a series of epidemiological models that include different configurations of population structures. Then I will fit these models to time-series data from a network of disease monitoring plots to determine what components of forest population structure are most important for prediction of disease spread. Using the most parsimoniuous models, I will determine optimal schedules of treatment to minimize the probability of disease outbreak.</p>
<h1 id="introduction-modeling-disease-in-complex-populations-for-management">Introduction: Modeling Disease in Complex Populations for Management</h1>
<p>Forest diseases can radically transform ecosystems. In North America, chestnut blight, Dutch elm disease and beech bark disease have caused precipitous declines in their hosts, leading to changes in the structure and function of forests. Changes from such diseases may be the dominant force changing the face of some forests in coming decades, overwhelming other forms of rapid environmental change such as climate change <span class="citation">(Lovett et al. 2006)</span>.</p>
<p>Even simple host-disease systems exhibit complex dynamics <span class="citation">(Kermack and Mckendrick 1927)</span>. Forest disease dynamics include additional complexity driven by variation in pathogen and host populations, spatial strucure, pathogen life cycles, and demographic and environmental stochasticity <span class="citation">(Hansen and Goheen 2000, Holdenrieder et al. 2004)</span>. These factors yield greater complexity in disease dynamics. This complexity, combined with limited monitoring data and the uncertainty of the parameters of emergent diseases, makes prediction of disease dynamics difficult. Yet such prediction is needed decision-making in allocating limited resources for treatment and prevention.</p>
<p>One area of complexity in forest systems is structured variation in host populations. Host tree populations may consist of multiple species or genotypes, and consist of multiple sizes, each of which may interact with disease or each other differently <span class="citation">(Gilbert and Hubbell 1996)</span>. All forest tree populations are spatially structured; non-motile individuals can not be &quot;well-mixed&quot; <span class="citation">(Filipe and Maule 2003)</span>. Each of these forms of population structure have consequences for population dynamics that have been examined in theoretical models <span class="citation">(Park et al. 2001, 2002, Dobson 2004, Klepac and Caswell 2010)</span>. However, dynamics resulting from these components of population structure interacting are not well-characterized.</p>
<p>Understanding modeled dynamics of disease in structured populations may provide insights useful for management. However, the ability to use such models for management planning depends requires confidence in their predictive power, particularly under novel management treatments. Recent developments in <em>particle filter</em> techniques allow estimation of the likelihoods of complex dynamic models <span class="citation">(Arulampalam et al. 2002, Ionides et al. 2006, Knape and de Valpine 2012)</span>, and subsequent comparison of models in out-of-sample predictive performance <span class="citation">(Vehtari and Ojanen 2012)</span>. Fitting the dynamic models in full provides more confidence in the dynamic results than deriving madel parameters individually from data, because it tests whether models' emergent dynamics are supported by the data.</p>
<p>Modeling multidimensional population structure is problematic for several reasons. First, as models get increasingly complex, analytic solutions are less likely to be tractable, and complete characterization of model behavior is unlikely. Thus model (and) system behavior is more difficult to explore. Secondly, high-dimensional models are difficult to estimate; each additional form of population structure multiplies the parameters involved, and requires additional data.</p>
<p>Sudden oak death (SOD) is an emerging forest disease in California and Oregon that threatens populations of tanoak (<em>Notholithocarpus densiflorus</em>) <span class="citation">(Rizzo and Garbelotto 2003)</span>, and has the potential to modify community structure <span class="citation">(Metz et al. 2012)</span>, and cause significant economic damage <span class="citation">(Kovacs et al. 2011)</span>. Silvicultural chemical, and other control techniques can modify the progression of disease <span class="citation">(Swiecki and Bernhardt 2013)</span>, but eradication of SOD is unlikely [@Cobb2013] even at local scales. Long and short- and long-term solutions to limit the damage of disease are needed will require continuous treatment and monitoring regimes. Under budget constraints, planning for such treatment can be informed by dynamics models via optimal control techniques.</p>
<p>I aim to answer the following overall questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How do interactions between community, size, and spatial structure affect disease dynamics in forests?</li>
<li>What aspects of population structure are most important in determining the probability and size of forest disease outbreaks in theoretical models?</li>
<li>What aspects of population structure are most important in <em>predicting</em> the probability and size of SOD outbreaks?</li>
<li>What population structure minimizes the risk of SOD outbreak while maintaining desirable populations of at-risk species?</li>
<li>What is the most cost-effective strategy for maintaining populations of tree species in the presence of SOD?</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<h2 id="sudden-oak-death">Sudden Oak Death</h2>
<p>Sudden Oak Death (SOD) is an emerging forest disease in California and Oregon that poses risks to forest across North America. First observed in California in the mid-1990s, SOD is caused by the water mold <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em> <span class="citation">(Rizzo et al. 2002)</span>. <em>P. ramorum</em> often kills tanoak (<em>Notholithocarpus densiflorus</em>), which provide habitat and food to many vertebrate species, and are the primary host of ectomycorrhizal fungi in redwood forests <span class="citation">(Rizzo and Garbelotto 2003)</span>. Loss of this species may have cascading effects on other species. The disease has also caused significant economic damage through removal costs and property value reduction <span class="citation">(Kovacs et al. 2011)</span>. It has the potential to spread to species in other regions, such as northern red oak (<em>Quercus rubra</em>), one of the most important eastern timber species <span class="citation">(Rizzo et al. 2002)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="population-structure-multiple-host-species">Population Structure: Multiple Host Species</h2>
<p><em>Phytophthora ramorum</em> has over 100 host species in 40 genera, which fall into several functional types <span class="citation">(Swiecki and Bernhardt 2013)</span>. In canker hosts, which are all members of <em>Fagaceae</em> in California, pathogen produces cankers in the trunk. Few if any spores are produced from the cankers, and these hosts are generally dead ends. SOD is fatal to many canker costs. In foliar hosts, <em>P. ramorum</em> resides and reproduces in leaves and twigs. Foliar hosts vary greatly in suscepibility to disease and spore production from diseased individuals. Some hosts are dead ends; others are major drivers of disease spread and survival.</p>
<p>In Redwood forests in Northern California, the hosts of importance are tanoak and bay laurel (<em>Umbellularia californica</em>). Tanoak has the dubious distinction of being the only species that is both a canker and foliar host, and the disease is generally lethal in these trees. Bay laurel is a foliar host in which <em>P. ramorum</em> produces prolifically, and it suffers no harm from the disease <span class="citation">(DiLeo et al. 2009)</span>. Redwood and other species are unsusceptible or dead-end hosts where <em>P. ramorum</em> has little detrimental effect. In forests of the redwood-tanoak-bay complex, bay Laurel acts as the primary disease reservoir [@Davidso2008]. Tanoak infection and mortality is dependent on bay laurel density <span class="citation">(Cobb et al. 2012)</span>, and removal of laurel is a commonly suggested treatment to reduce risk of SOD <span class="citation">(@Filipe2013; Swiecki and Bernhardt 2013)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Dobson (2004)</span> examined a model of disease in multiple host species based on an the SIR <span class="citation">(Kermack and Mckendrick 1927)</span> framework. In it, species had density dependence but interacted only though disease transmission. Importantly, transmission between species was always equal or less than transmission between species. Dobson found that in when transmission was density-dependent, species had a complementary effect on the disease's rate of reproduction <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28R_0%29" alt="(R_0)" title="(R_0)" />; that is, a mix of both species led to faster outbreaks. However, in frequency-dependent case, <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R_0" alt="R_0" title="R_0" /> was greatest when one species dominated. Transmission between species dampens and synchronizes disease oscillations in each species, and at very high contact rates between species the most susceptible species are more like to go extinct. <span class="citation">Craft and Hawthorne (2008)</span> implemented a stochastic version of this model in a system of mamallian carnivores, finding that species with low intra-species contact rates acted as sinks for disease, and their contact with more social species increased spread disease within these low-contact species.</p>
<p>SOD dynamics differ from these systems in a few important ways. First, the contact structure among species may not be symmetrical, and between-species contacts may be as high as within. Contact rates in this case are driven by differences in species transmissivity (amount of spore produced) and susceptibility (probability of infection per spore) rather than social grouping. Where one species with high transmissivity coexists with a species of high susceptibility, the probability of transmission may be higher between species than within. Also, the spatial structure of species, and the dispersal pattern of spores, may result in a hybrid between density and frequency-dependent disease transmissions.</p>
<h2 id="population-structure-sizestage-classes">Population Structure: Size/Stage Classes</h2>
<p>Within the tanoak population, epidemiological characteristics vary with tree size. Trees of larger size classes are more likely to be infected and die more quickly than smaller tree <span class="citation">(Cobb et al. 2012)</span>, Possibly due to the vulnerability of cracked bark and the amount of bark tissue available for invasion <span class="citation">(Swiecki and Bernhardt 2005)</span>. There is no evidence currently for differences in spore production or other physiological effecst across tree sizes [@Davidson2008].</p>
<p>When disease dynamics occur much faster than demographic processes, we can treat size classes similarly to different species, and examine the progression of disease in a constant population structure. However, when disease progression and growth occur at similar rates, these processes can interact to produce complex dynamics. This is the case with SOD; infectious periods can last many years, during which trees may continue to grow.</p>
<p>The effects of age-based population structure and contact rates have been studied extensively in the context of human disease and vaccination programs <span class="citation">(Anderson and May 1985, <span class="citation"></span>)</span>. Reducing in-class transmission rates at young ages increases the average age of infection, independent of the exact contact structure. When only the susceptibility, and not transmissivity, of each age class varies,</p>
<p><span class="citation">Klepac and Caswell (2010)</span> created a framwork for examining disease dynamics in stage-structured populations. In this, disease and epidemiological processes are alternate in time (TODO: <em>periodic something</em>). This approximation holds with SOD in California, where most sporulation occurs during the winter rainy months, while tree growth occurs in the spring and fall [TODO:ref].</p>
<p><span class="citation">Klepac and Caswell (2010)</span> found that increases in within-class transmission increases both the infected and recovered population, relative increases in that class</p>
<p>Protecting a class drives average age at infection to other classes. If infection is most common in the young, then vaccination increases age to infection. Vaccination in the old will, too, but much less. Accentuates oscillation. ˜</p>
<p>In SOD, contact rates appear to depend less on mixing rates. But transmissivity varies across species, and suscepibility varies across age classes.</p>
<h2 id="population-structure-space">Population Structure: Space</h2>
<p><em>P. Ramorum</em> dispersal interacts with host population structure at many scales. The pathogen spreads between trees via wind-blown rain, and splash, limiting most spores to spread within 15m of host plants <span class="citation">(Davidson et al. 2005)</span>. However, occaisional weather events, such as fog, can transport spores up to 3 km <span class="citation">(Rizzo et al. 2005)</span>. Over long distances, <em>P. ramorum</em> can be transported in streams or spread via human-mediated vectors such as nursery plant trade [@Osterbauer2004]. <span class="citation">Meentemeyer et al. (2011)</span> found that the best fit kernel for <em>P. ramorum spread</em> was the sum of two Cauchy kernels, one on the scale of tens of meters and another on the scale of tens of kilometers.</p>
<p>Despite the ability to spread long distance, strong meter-scale gradients mean that individual trees in stands can not be considered &quot;well mixed&quot; in terms of contact rates between trees. Rather, contact patterns across space arise from the interaction of spatial clustering of trees and the dispersal kernel of the disease. Neither frequency- nor density-dependent transmission characterizes this arrangement.</p>
<p>The effect on such spatial structure on development of epidemics has been studied with continuous populations in space [@Bolker1999], metapopulation models (<span class="citation">Park et al. (2001)</span>; <span class="citation">Park et al. (2002)</span>), models of individuals on a lattice <span class="citation">(Filipe and Maule 2003, 2004)</span> and discrete individuals in continuous space (<span class="citation">Brown and Bolker (2004)</span>). These approaches have reached similar conclusions of the effect of spatial structure in non-mobile populations. In all cases, the threshold of disease growth for a global outbreak <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28R_0%29" alt="(R_0)" title="(R_0)" /> is greater than the threshold for a local epidemic <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28R_L%29" alt="(R_L)" title="(R_L)" />. For instance, in metapopulations on a lattice, <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R_0%20%3D%20R_L%20%281%20%2B%20z%5Cvarepsilon%29" alt="R_0 = R_L (1 + z\varepsilon)" title="R_0 = R_L (1 + z\varepsilon)" />, where <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z" alt="z" title="z" /> is the average number of connections between patches and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvarepsilon" alt="\varepsilon" title="\varepsilon" /> is the inter-patch contact rates <span class="citation">(Park et al. 2001)</span>. In models of discrete individuals in space, <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R_0%20%3D%20%5Clambda%281%20%2B%20%5Cbar%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D%20SI%29" alt="R_0 = \lambda(1 + \bar{\mathcal{C}} SI)" title="R_0 = \lambda(1 + \bar{\mathcal{C}} SI)" />, where <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clambda" alt="\lambda" title="\lambda" /> would be the pathogen growth rate in a well-mixed population, and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbar%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D" alt="\bar{\mathcal{C}}" title="\bar{\mathcal{C}}" /> is the dispersal kernel-weighted spatial correlation between susceptible and infected individuals. <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbar%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%7D" alt="\bar{\mathcal{C}}" title="\bar{\mathcal{C}}" /> evolves over time but reaches a minimum that represents the threshold required for a global epidemic <span class="citation">(Brown and Bolker 2004)</span>. Also, both clustering and anti-clustering (oversdispersal) reduce the rate of increase of disease, except when clustering occurs at the scale of dispersal, in which case it can accellerate spread. Fat-tailed dispersal kernels accellerate spread, as well.</p>
<h1 id="study-approach">Study Approach</h1>
<p>I will examine the comparative importance of these components of population structure by (1) characterizing the dynamic behavior of models that include each type of structure and their combinations and (2) identifying the model structure that best predicts data of disease spread over time in redwood-tanoak-bay forests. Using the best-fit model, I determine optimal paths for silvicultural and stand protection treatments to minimize the risk of outbreak over time</p>
<h2 id="comparative-dynamics">Comparative Dynamics</h2>
<p>To characterize the effects of the population structure on disease dynamics, I will compare four models. All are extensions of the epidemiological model of <span class="citation">Cobb et al. (2012)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Model A</strong> is the simplest of the four models, only representing structure in the form of differences between species of trees. It is described by this system of stochastic difference equations:</p>

<p>New susceptible trees enter the system via density-dependent seedling recruitment and resprouting from recently killed trees.

Both susceptible and infected trees die at constant rates.</p>
<p>The model is modified from <span class="citation">Cobb et al.

Finally, the only population structure in Model A is the difference in species parameters. It excludes age structure, and spatial structure, assuming a well-mixed population and frequency-dependent transmission (Following <span class="citation">Diekmann et al. (1990)</span>)</p>
<p>The model will be parameterized with three speces: tanoak, bay, and redwood, which will represent all non-host species. And run with initial conditions found in <span class="citation">Cobb et al. (2012)</span> and @Filipe2013.</p>

<h2 id="model-fitting-and-selection">Model Fitting and Selection</h2>
<p>In order to determine which model to use for planning and management, I must select from the model structures above by determining which best represents observations from time series data.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>Data to fit the models comes from a collaboration with the Rizzo lab's diease monitoring plot network. The data consist of observations tree size, condition, and disease status from the years 2002-2007. Trees were observed in 14 sites along the California coast from X (36.16°N) to Y (38.35°N), each of which contains X-X 500 m<sup>2</sup>, seperated by minimium distances of Z. All plots are in forests dominated by redwood, tanoak, and Bay Laurel, with negligible other SOD host species.</p>
<p>Size, health, and disease status of all trees were measured in 2002 and 2007, as well as for a random sample of 5 trees of each species in the years 2003-2006.</p>
<p>Each plot within a site will represent one subpopulation within the metapopulation lattice, with the matrix of metapopulations around counting as unobserved.</p>
<h2 id="model-fitting">Model fitting</h2>
<p>The processes generating the data above may be considered <strong>hidden Markov process</strong> <span class="citation">(Gimenez et al. 2012)</span>, that is, processes where the state of the system is dependent on its previous state, but where states are partially or imperfectly observed. Each model in Table 1 represents one such process.</p>
<p>In order estimate the hidden Markov process, I require a method to calculate.</p>
<p><strong>Particle filtering</strong> determines the likelihood of a hidden Markov process by taking advantage of the fact that, at each time step, the likelihood of a system state is dependent on the previous state, and the observation</p>
<p>p(X_t) = p(X_t | X_{t-1}, Y_t)</p>
<p>The likelihood of the model, given the all of the data, may then be expressed as</p>
<p><br /><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%20" alt=" " title=" " /><br /> <span class="citation">(Arulampalam et al. 2002)</span></p>
<p>Since <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p%28X_t%20%7C%20X_%7Bt-1%7D%29" alt="p(X_t | X_{t-1})" title="p(X_t | X_{t-1})" /> is unknown, It's value is determined at each time step by simulation.</p>
<p>PFMCMC requires two components to the model. A <strong>process model</strong> which simulates the states <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28X_t%29" alt="(X_t)" title="(X_t)" /> of the model, and an <strong>observation model</strong> of the observations at each time point, given underlying states <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28Y_t%20%7C%20X_t%29" alt="(Y_t | X_t)" title="(Y_t | X_t)" />. Unlike the process model, the observation model must have a tractable likelihood.</p>
<p>For my process model, I will assume that tree presence, size, and location alive/dead status are measured exactly, but that disease status is observed imperfectly via the conditional probabilites <br /><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A%20p_OI%20%26%3D%20p%28%5Ctext%7BObserving%20that%20tree%20is%20diseased%7D%7C%5Ctext%7Btree%20is%20diseased%7D%29%0A%20p_OS%20%26%3D%20p%28%5Ctext%7BObserving%20that%20tree%20is%20healty%7D%7C%5Ctext%7Btree%20is%20healthy%7D%29%0A%5Cend%7Baligned%7D" alt="\begin{aligned}

\end{aligned}" /><br /></p>
<p>In addition, I assume that the smallest size class is unobserved in models with size classes.</p>
<p>With an estimate of likelihood available, one needs an approach to determine the maximum-likelihood estimate of the model parameters <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28%5Ctheta%29" alt="(\theta)" title="(\theta)" />. Several methods are available. <strong>Iterated filtering</strong> (IF) estimates <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta" alt="\theta" title="\theta" /> by replacing constant parameter values with a random walk <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta_t" alt="\theta_t" title="\theta_t" /> of decreasing variance over time, and determining the &quot;states&quot; of this walk as the variance approaches zero. IF is computationally efficient but requires long time series.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>Particle Filter Markov Chain Monte Carlo</strong> (PFMCMC) uses a Markov Chain sampler (e.g., Metropolis-Hastings), calculating the likelihood at each iteration using a particle filter. While computationally expensive, it does not require long time series and may be used with multiple, independent time series. PFMCMC also integrates particle filtering into a Bayesian context, allowing the use of informative priors.</p>
<h2 id="model-selection">Model selection</h2>
<p>Model selection has multiple purposes. First, to determine which model best is most like the true purpose, and to estimate the valdiity of the models for the purposes of prediction. DIC has several advantages. First, it incoporates any random variables. Secondly, it estimates the loss of parameters from Bayesian inference. As several components of the model have useul priors estimated form either data sets, this is useful in this case.</p>
<p>PFMCMC will provide maximum-likelihood parameter estimates and likelihoods for each of the model structures.</p>
<p>In order to compare them, I will use the <strong>deviance information criterion</strong> <span class="citation">(Spiegelhalter et al. 2002, DIC)</span>, which is defined as</p>
<p><br /><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctext%7BDIC%7D%20%3D%20D%28%5Cbar%5Ctheta%29%20%2B%202p_D" alt="\text{DIC} = D(\bar\theta) + 2p_D" title="\text{DIC} = D(\bar\theta) + 2p_D" /><br /></p>
<p>where <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p_D" alt="p_D" title="p_D" /> is a metric of model complexity (effective number of parameters) and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?D" alt="D" title="D" /> is the deviance (-2 <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctimes" alt="\times" title="\times" /> log likelihood). <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p_D" alt="p_D" title="p_D" /> defined as</p>
<p><br /><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p_D%20%3D%20%5Coverline%7BD%28%5Ctheta%29%7D%20-%20D%28%5Cbar%7B%5Ctheta%7D%29" alt="p_D = \overline{D(\theta)} - D(\bar{\theta})" title="p_D = \overline{D(\theta)} - D(\bar{\theta})" /><br /></p>
<p><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p_D" alt="p_D" title="p_D" /> may be redfined as <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bp_D%7D%7Bn%7D" alt="\frac{p_D}{n}" title="\frac{p_D}{n}" /> to correct for the amount of data.</p>
<p>DIC provides a measure of fit and complexity. It has two primary advantages over traditional measures of fit such as BIC and AIC. First, since <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p_D" alt="p_D" title="p_D" /> is based on the likelihood distribution, it incorporates information from the prior. Effectively, it reduces the effective number of parameters when they are restricted due to the prior. Secondly, the same property allows the effective number of parameters from random variables to be included.</p>
<p>Use of DIC assumes that there is a &quot;best&quot; or &quot;real&quot; model within the comparison. While no models are &quot;true&quot; <span class="citation">(Box 1976)</span>, this excercise is selecting a &quot;best&quot; or &quot;most useful&quot; model for scenario exploration, rather than predictive model-averaging.</p>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>Using the model developed above I will derive optimal control strategies for forest management under the threat of disease outbreak. The basis of this work will be the <span class="citation">Hartman (1976)</span> economic modeling framework, in which forest owners are motivated by dual goals of continuous ecosystem service amenities and profit from timber harvest. Under this framework, the optimal control will minimize the costs associated with quarantine and equipment cleaning, while maximizing both the standing biomass of valued species and their timber value. Both time discounting and risk-aversion will be included in the maximization scheme.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Reed (1984)</span> described a forestry model where age-dependent risk of fire modifies the optimal harvest rotation of forest. Fire risk (a nonhomogenous Poisson process) changes through time.</p>
<p>A stochastic implementation of the most parsimonious model will generate a risk of outbreak as a function of forest composition and time. (See Fig 1)</p>
<p>An outline of</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The best-fit model provides us with estimates of the probability over disease outbreaks in a forest stand over a management period. This probability is contingent on both forest composition and spatial structure, and the burden of spores from other areas, and changes over time as forest dynamics change the host population.</p>
<p>By assuming that disease at below-outbreak levels has a negligible effect forest growth, this model can be simplified into a model of disease-free forest dynamics, and an evolving probability of outbreak that changes as a function of forest composition.</p>
<p>By considering probability of disease outbreak a nonhomogenous poisson process, we may use the <span class="citation">Reed (1984)</span> framework and extensions to calculate optimal control techniques.</p>
<p>This becomes n optimal control problem in which <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c_1" alt="c_1" title="c_1" /> is the annual cost of reducing the probability of disease arrival <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CLambda_t" alt="\Lambda_t" title="\Lambda_t" />, and <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c_2" alt="c_2" title="c_2" /> is the cost of silvicultural treatment in any year of cutting.</p>
<p>The goal will be to solve the dynamic optimization.</p>
<p>Probability of outbreak will be reduced with lower populations of trees.</p>
<p>Contraints:</p>
<p>Budget (both annual and total scenarios) --&gt; Minimize outbreak probability Maximum probability of outbreak --&gt; Minimize cost</p></li>
<li><p>Both composition and the arrival of disease can be modified by controls. Select cutting may modify the composition and managment actions such as the cleaning of logging equipment can reduce the arrival of spores. Pesticides can also reduce the probability of spores successfully infecting healthy trees. All of these management actions (including logging) have costs, and are limited by budget constraints of management agencies and/or landowners</p></li>
<li><p>The solution to this optimal control problem will be an optimal <em>treatment rotation</em> - a schedule of harvest and spraying actions that minimize risk over the treatment period.</p></li>
<li><p>An alternative useful formulation of the problem is to determine the minimum-cost method given constraints of desired tree population and <em>maximum acceptable probability of outbreak</em>. An advantage of this approach is to provide managers with an method of implicit valuation of the tanoak population by illustrating the trade-off between costs and acceptable tree populations and risks.</p></li>
<li><p>Examine under a variety of regulatory constraints: limiting herbicide use for suppressing sprounts and others, harvest regulations in riparian areas, endangered species limitation on time/space of cutting.</p></li>
<li><p>An extension of the analysis above will include the parameter uncertainty of the best-fit model, and an optimization under the scenario that parameter uncertainties decrease with time</p></li>

<hr />
<h1 id="optimization-1">Optimization</h1>
<p>The best-fit model that captures essential aspects of the disease dynamics will be used to develop an optimal control solution to minimization of disease risk over time.</p>
<p>In this, modeled after the XXXX area outbreak, goals for SOD forest management can be approximated as (a) maintaining a minimum density of at-risk species (i.e., tanoak), and (b) minimizing the probability of outbreak.</p>
<p>Tools for SOD control can be categorized into two types. Silvicultural (“host-centric”) treatments change forest composition. “Pathogen-centric” treatments, such as quarantine, equipment cleaning and spraying, reduce the probability of spore arrival.</p>
<p>Cutting events are discrete, periodic treatments that change forest composition. A cut can reduce the density of any class and species to either the levels associated with minimum probability of outbreak, or to minimum socially acceptable densities. Tanoak and bay laurel trees have little timber value (@REF), so each cut has a one-time cost, <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c_1" alt="c_1" title="c_1" />. For the purpose of this model <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c_1" alt="c_1" title="c_1" /> is independent of the extent of density reduction.</p>
<p><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c_2" alt="c_2" title="c_2" /> represents the combined annual costs of measures to reduce the external force of infection <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clambda_%7B%5Ctext%7Bex%7D%7D" alt="\lambda_{\text{ex}}" title="\lambda_{\text{ex}}" />.</p>
<p>This model could be optimized by defining a function for the value of ecosystem services flowing annually from the forest annually as a function of the forest composition <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f%28N_t%29" alt="f(N_t)" title="f(N_t)" /> [@Hartmann1976]. However, due to the difficulty of defining and valuing these services, it is more feasible to define constraints that represent the range of socially acceptable outcomes.</p>
<p>The constraint that makes most sense is a <em>minimum acceeptable density of the species of interest</em> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28N_%7B%5Cmin%7D%29" alt="(N_{\min})" title="(N_{\min})" />. This value could be further specified to include, for instance, a minimum density of trees of a minimum size. Since the system is stochastic, this constraint expressed by a <em>level of acceptable risk</em>, the probability that the species density will fall beneath this value <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28p_%7B%5Ctext%7Bacc%7D%7D%20%3E%20p%28N_t%20%3C%20N_%7B%5Cmin%7D%29" alt="(p_{\text{acc}} &gt; p(N_t &lt; N_{\min})" title="(p_{\text{acc}} &gt; p(N_t &lt; N_{\min})" />.</p>
<p>The dynamic optimization problem is to minimize the cost of treatment while maintaining the outbreak probability below <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p_%7B%5Ctext%7Bacc%7D%7D" alt="p_{\text{acc}}" title="p_{\text{acc}}" />:</p>
