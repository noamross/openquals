# @Tainter1996, Chapter 15.2: White Pine Blister Rusts

## General Rust Biology

 - Fungi with multiple (up to 5!) spore stages.
 - Most important pathogens are *heteroecious*: have life cycles that span multiple hosts
 - Stem invaders are more destrutive than needle or leaf invaders
 
## White Pine Blister Rust

### Summary

 - Caused by *Cronarium ribicola*.  Heteoecious rust with stages on pine galls and on *Ribes* (gooseberry) leaves. Sexual fruiting bodies (pycnia) of the fungus occur late spring/summer 2-3 yr after infections, followed 1 year later by aecia (nonexual fruiting bodies).  Aeciospores infect 8Ribes* through stomata, and then can have several cycles of reinfection in *Ribes* over the summer.   Teliospores form in weeks-to-months on *Ribes*, germinating aand produce sexual offspring that infect pines through stomata.  Mycelia grow from needles into branch or stem where they form galls in 12-18 months.
 - Cool, wet weather disease
 - Diagnosis:  Spindle-shaped gall preceeded by yellow needle lsions (sometimes).  Galls start as yellow-orange spots on bark.  Dieback ovvurs of infected branches.  Droplets of aeciaspores produced abundantly on cankers.
 - Introduced in U.S> ~1906 on diseased stock from Germany
 - Effects almost all white pines.  A few species resistant/immune.
 - Prevents planting in areas where the disease has high incidence
 - Eradication by cutting or herbicide has not been effective in high-hazard areas, but has been feasible in medium risk areas.  Slecion and breeding, pruning of infected branches for high-value trees.  Biological control via *Tuberculina maxima*, a fungus that invades and kills the pathogen in the trees.  
 
### Importance

 - Important disease economically, as it infects high-value timber stands.  Kills all sizes, but most damaging in young stands where it prevents reaching harvestable age.
- Locally destructive in lake states, hugely problematic in California Inland Empire

### Origins and distribution

- Thought to be from Siberia
- Brought to Europe ~1800, became epidemic 1880 on *P. strobus*
- Brought to China, US,  Japan ~1900.  Many introductions on nursery stock

### Biology

 - Spore lands on needle in the fall, and germ tubes penetrate, then go down stems and branch.  Spots for on bark in 12-18 months, and expand continually until tree dies. Hyphae take nutrients from host cells.  First spores (pycnia) ooze out of cankers in 2-4 years, staying on trunk in hard deposits of resin.  Next spores (aecia) form 3-6 years after invasion, appearing as yellow blister which burst and spread the spores via winto *Ribes*
- Cankers can kill tree above, leaving live branches below
- On *Ribes* aecia form basidospores which germinate in the plant, then can have up to 7 generations of urediniospores in a season, re-infecting that plant or others.  Finally teliospores form 4 basidiospores beach and these are blown back to the pine.  If they land on the wrong host they can reproduce and be blown to a new host.

### Epidemiology

 - Point of control is infection of pine host by basidiospores.
 - Germination of teliospores (to release basidiospores to travel from *Ribes* to pine) requires ~48 hours of <28°C temps, and release of basidiospores probably occurs after rain
- In CA and OR, it was determined that rust hazard depends on summer/fall conditions.  Easier to spread north, because southerly winds coincided with moster conditions
- Basidiospores are small and can travel long distances, but have low viability.  Long-distance transport occurs but only in favorable conditions.   Local risk can be approximated by climate
- Where macroclimate is poor, infections only travel short distances and effects like slope and stand structure are more important, because they control microclimate.  Clearing edge and clear-cuts have higher infection rates because of cooler and wetter nighttime conditions and air currents
- *Ribes* is suppressed under a closed canopy, but has a considerable seed bank.  Opening canopy or disturbing soil can cause it to grow.  It will always grow on banks and ridges.  Seed bank response to fire depends on timing.
- More vigorous hosts are more susceptible, but older trees are more resistant, and can limit infection to some branches, with branches dying before infection reaches bole

### Control

 - Traditional control has been *Ribes* eradication in U.S., but in Europe *Ribes* are valued
 - In western U.S., *Ribes* are very abundant and even with herbicide, eradication is very difficult.  Only economical in areas with high aesthetic value
 - Chemical antibiotics applied to cnkers and foliage have been used, but not successful
 - Most promising has been resistance breeding.  In western white pine, resistance has many mechanisms: resistance of needles to infection, shedding infected needles, and failure to develop stem cankers.  Multiple mechanisms needed to fight new mutations in pathogen.
 - Combination of limited resistance with other controls can minimize losses and maintain diversity
 - In Sugar pine, there is a single gene absolute resistance, but some strains of pathogen can overcome it.
 - Site hazard rating is commonly used, based on combination of macroclimate and site variables.
 - Lake state hazard zones:
    -   Low
    -   Moderate: Avoid high hazard microsites, eliminate *Ribes* in sites and aras from which air comes
    -    High: Only plant white pine under overstores with no *Ribes*
    -    Very High: Only plant in large blocks to cover costs, maintaining overstory and using resistant stock, eliminate *Ribes* and create barrier strips.
  - Since infections occur low, pruning is possible in dense stands but labor-intensive.  All lower branches should be removed if there is infection, to stop cryptic infection. 
 - Use of *T. maxima* as biological control is possible, but only works on low-vigor pathogen strains and usually dies before it eliminates all of the disease.
 - Difficult to forecast the disease because of the many inetractions
 

# @Geils2010: White pines, *Ribes*, and blister rust

*This is a review as part of a [special issue](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.2010.40.issue-3-4)* on white pine blister rust.

## Historical and geographical background

WPBR is multiple epidemics in Asia, Europe, and NA, each with unique histories.

White pines consist mostly of the subgenera *Strubus*, though many of them are difficult to place taxonomically within this.  Found mostly in the NA, it was imported to Europe in the 17th century for timber, and use became widespread there in the 1800s.  White pine forests in NA were heavily logged.

*Ribes* is important in Europe for balck currant production.

## Stem rusts

Rusts rarely overwinter on *Ribes*, as leaves are shed in winter, so overwintering must take place on the pine.

## Pathology and Ecology

Some resistance is due to needle morphology, others to mecrotic bark periderm.

Sporulation exposes the inner bark to dessication and attack by other agents (insects, fungi).

## Biogeographic history

In Eastern US, there were many introductions over a long time in many locations.  In the west, there were a few of limited duration and area.  But in the west, there are more white pine and *Ribes* species distributed across more environments.

## From disease control to silviculture and genetics

Quarantine was imposed on infected stock form Europe in the early 1900s, but by then nursery stock was already infected.

# @Tainter1996, Chapter 15.2: Fusiform Rust

## Importance

-   Initially rare, but has become most important disease on lolobolly and slash pines, even though it only occurs in the southeastern U.S.
-   Increae is due to combination of "land abuse", fire control, intensity of management
-   Attacks stem and branches of pines, leaves of oaks.  Does not harm oaks, but can kill pines.
-   Lethality decreases with age.  Kills seedlings, deforms older trees so they are worth less or break from wind, or are left vulnerable to decay fungi

## Hosts

-   The fungus, *Cronartium quercumm*, is hereoecious.  Pcial and aecial stages on pines, uredinial and telial stages on oaks.
-   Presently only a major prblem on loblolly and slash pines, lesser on longliead and pines.  Jeffery, Monterey, and ponderosa are susceptible, but haven't been invaded.
-   Most oaks can act a host. Esp. water ad willow, not so much white oaks.  Water and laurel oaks are key hosts.

## Distribution

-  *C. quercumm* has coevolved with pines and always been present, but first described in 1896
-  Disease became more prevalant as forest composition was modified by fire suppression, land clearing and replanting.  Lolbolly and slash pine replace much longleaf pine.

## Pathogen

-  *C. quercumm* is actually a complex of four near-indistinguishable "forms" formerly thought of as fusiform, which are pathogenic on different pines and have different shape galls. *fusiforme* is the group associated with this disease
-   Rust is heteroecious, with two stages on pines and two on oaks.
-   Aecia develop from galls, mostly in late winter.  Theey can retain viability  for a long time under cool, dry conditions.  Disseminated by wind and settle on young oak leaves.
-   Film of water required for germination and infection, and late frost can kill leaves, reducing infection.  Aecia only invade the leaves, via the stomta.
-   In oaks, invasian is intercellular.  Yellow-orange spots form, urendina grow from underside of leaf, and produce column of telia (hair-like), which release badsidiospores.  Urendina can also be dispersed by win and re-infect oak in spring
-   Badsidiospores are dispersed by wind to pines, but are delicate and short lived, and need moist atmosphere and cool temperaterures in the spring-early summer
-   Infection of pine occurs thourgh needles or succulent stem, as well as through wounds.  Proceeds to cambium of the main stem.
-   After infection, external symptoms occur 5-6 months later.  Galls elongate down branches at ~5 cm/yr, down trunk 2-3 times as fast.  Galls develop faster on younger trees. 

## Epidemiology

-   Spring weather effects severity of rust each year, influencing production and dissemination of spores, survival of spores, timing of host availability (esp. immature tissues).
-   Ideal conditions are warm Feb-Mar and cool, wet Apr-May, with long (> 18 hr) moist periods.  This results in early growth of hosts, but long susceptibility and active fungus.  12+ hours of moisture needed because telio and basidiospre growth, germination and infection must occur continuously.
-   Even-aged stands are usually more damaged.  Slower, shaded trees have less infection.  Fertilization causes more infection due to shoot succulence.  Disturbance on the site favors oak and more disease.

## Control Strategy

### Nurseries

-   Control varies with vlaue of crop.  Nursery locations are picked based on prevalance on existing pines (longlead).
-   Spraying seedlings with fungicides just prior to periods of spore release (requires accurate weather forecast) reduceds nursery infections to <0.5%.  Many applications required for effective control, until more modern soil-applied fungicides.  Individual seedling inspection too costly - onus is on buyer.
-   Eradication of oaks around nusery sites now disfavored for conservation reasons.
-   Late sowing reduces losses, but leaves plants vulnerable to other disease.

### Plantations and Natural Stands

-   Dense planting causes self-pruning, preventing branch cankers from reaching the main stem, and also suppressing oak growth.  However may get poor tree growth.  Diseased trees should not be removed if they result in excessive thinning.
-   Pruning not economically justified and also creates wounds which could be infected
-   Fire kills galled trees and lower branches, but also results in flush spring growth that increases disease.  Not recommended.
-   Fertilization and cultivation not economically worthwhile in high-risk sites due to increase in disease
-  Use of Resistance Species: Shortleaf and longleaf pines are resistant, and lolbolly sustains less damage than slsh in high-risk areas. 
-   Use of resistant strains, planted in mixtures to prevent co-evolution of 
*Cronartium quercumm*


# @Tainter1996, Chapter 14.2: Needle Blight (focus on Brown Spot)


## Importance

 - Longleaf pine has decreased due to fire suppression, which has prevented regeneration in part due to allowing needle blight to occur
-   Defoliates seedlings, which often kills them, and if not, weakens and stunts development, increasing "grass stage" from 3-5 to 8-10 yrs.
-   Sometimes can cause needle loss in older trees, but has never killed adults.  But enough to cause loss for ornamental tree growers.


## Hosts

- Longleaf pine most susceptible, other pines less.  Variability among longleaf seedlings
-   Also important in Scots pine Christmas trees and red pine in WI.

## Distribution

- First obseved in SC in 1876, recognized as a serious disease since 1919, after fire protection began around 1915

## Pathogen

 - Fungus that has been reclassified many ties.  Currently (1996) *Mycophaseralla dearnessii*
 - Disease development is year-round, though slower in winter.
 - Ascospores and conidia produced on dead needles or dead portions of them.  Lands on needle tips.  Most abundant in spring and late summer peak.  Forcibly discharged during moist periods.  Ascospores are wind-blown but relatively minor importance, while conidia are primary form of infection and a rain-borne, and sticky, so can be transported via vectors such as livestock hooves.
- Penetration into needles occurs through stomata, may be enhanced by light.  High temps inhibiting.
- Leaves die and fungus continues to live on dead needles.  In cool weather, can grow thoughout needle rather than just forming spots.  Secondary infections occur within the plant.  Not very important on grown trees, as it only really spreads downwards.
- Continuous rainfall is primary factor in production.  24-48 hours of wet weather required for conidia production and dispersal.
- Ground cover is important determinant of output. Bare areas have more splash, possibly lower tree growth rates.
- Timing of leaf necrosis and spots depends on the region and host species.

## Control

-  Disease in endemic to large regions, can only be excluded after large burns have wiped it out in an area.  Keeping livestock out helps with this, as they are the longer-distance vectors.
- Prescribed fire is a good means of control, and can be used for many management purposes.  Was initially controversial.  Fire best applied in ~3 year rotations, after seedlings are 1-3 years old to prevent too much mortality, but also any time disease mortality is >20%.  Stands with more disease have higher fire mortality, esp. among smaller seedlings.  Winter fires cause less damage to the seedlings.  Fire in too small areas not effective.
- Pesticides effective, but can be expensive
- Fertilizer, competition control, and mycorhizzal fungi help trees leave grass stage faster, escaping the disease, but too much weeding increases disease
- Mixed cultivation of longleaf pine with other pines will reduce disease. 
- There is some varietal resistance, which is correlated with rapid height growth, though that is not the primary mechanism of resistance.

# Other Needle Blights:

## Elytroderma Needle Blight

- Effects Pondeosa and Jeffrey pine on West Coast, BC, AZ, NM
- Causes much more severe growth reduction and even mortality
- Ascospres resleased upon wetting and are wind dispersed
- Can colonize new needles as they form, colonizes twigs in the upple crown
- Low temperatures favor the disease, as does high stand density
- Affected twigs and branches have red terminals, curve upwards into "witches brooms"
- Predisposes to bark beetle attack.
- Fungicide impractical.  Avoiding dense stands, salvaging threatened and infected trees, avoiding infected saplings can reduce disease

## Lophoderium Needle Cast

 - Imported from Europe, most important to Chirstmas tree industry, most infection in red pine and short-needled Scots pine, but others also somewhat susceptible.
 - North temperate states, Canada
 - Ascospores distributed by wind after wetting.
 - Most outbreak in high density nurseries that are irrigated.  Takes 2-3 to severe nursery infection because of fluctuations in seasonal rain.
 - Inspection and early detection in nurseries important for reducing outbreak.  Fungicide at this point is very effective.  Long-needle varieties of Scots pine resistant

## Diplodia Tip Blight

 - Kills immatrue shoots of pine, mostly Austria pine and other exotics used for windbreaks and ornaments.  Never in wild in U.S.
 - Found globally between 40°N/S and 50°N/C, but not Asia
 - Spores released during wet weather, enters via stomates but also wounds and bruising from hail and insects.   Symptoms only on new grwoth, 2-3 weeks after infection.  After several years whole branches may dies.
 - Most severe in ~30 year old plntings, around age of self-thinning.  More abundant a year after wet season.  Needs 4 hr <24°C to sporulate.
 - Stunts and browns new shoots and needles, starting from lower crown. Looks like frost injury.
 - Fungicie following bud break is effective, mechanical removal is impractical.  Avoiding wounds right before growing season.


## Rhabdocline Needle Cast of Douglass-fir

- Fungus endemic to Doug-fir, native to Doug-fir stands but brought to Europe with the host, where it affects plantations
- Locally sporatic in U.S. plantings initially, now wherever grown exotically
- Ascospores wind-dispersed to new foliage on emergence in May/June
- Optimal but not obligate to wet weather for germination and penetration, best around 13°C but dormant below 10°C
- Produces yellow spots on aumn foliage, becoming purple-brown by spring, and falling off within a year
- Early detection and appliaction of fungicide for christmas planations.  Some inhertible resistance encountered.

## Swiss Needle Cast of Douglas-fir

- Affects young plantations, esp. Christmas trees.  Native and innocuous to wild Doug-fir stands
- Discovered in plantations in Europe, after host was brought there.  Occurs now wherever there are plntations
- Ascospores wind-disperesed and infect new foliage.  Moisture is important in production.
- Early detection and timely application of fungicide required.  Repeated annual application can restore infected seeds to full foliage, but more in plantings with lots of innoculum pressure.  Reistance widely reported.  


# @Tainter1996, Chapter 13: Root System decay

- Root diseases can be divided between those that attack small feeder roots and those that can rot the large woody ones.  The folowing covers the latter.
- Very difficult to detect and study
- More common in warm, moist climates and modified stands

## Annosum Root Disease

- More important in plantations with continuous root systems arising from homogeneity and dense spacing
- Causes mortality and reduced growth
- Very wide distribution in US and Canada, esp. southern and possibly western states. reported in most temperate nothern regions

### Hosts

 - Wide host range - 100 angiosperms and 126 gymnosperms, more important on the latter, esp southern pines (slash, lolbolly), eastern redcedar


### Pathogen

- Fungus *Heterbasidion annosum*, a fungus that can spread via wind-disseminated spores for many km.

### Epidemiology

- Infection occurs on stump surfaces and to a lesser extent root surfaces, and via root-root contacts.  Can grow through soil, as well.  Spres can descent through soil or be carried by burrowing animals.
- Spore production requires moderate temps and some moisture.  Occurs at on fruiting bodies near base of tree or stump.
- Freshly cut stumps very vulnerable to infection for days to weeks
- After infection mecyelia moves through stump and tree at ~1 m/yr.  5-10 years from infection to symptoms on adjacent trees.  Faster in suppressed than dominant trees.  Grows faster along bark than through core of root wood
- Soil composition important: Coarser soils with with moreately acid pH have more disease.

## Diagnosis

 - Fruiting bodies at base of trees, frequently below litter layer
 - Yellowing foliage, but sometimes death before this at high-risk sites.  Discolored red roots, then stringy decayed roots
 - Infection patches are irregular in  stand that increase in size.

## Control

- Limit thinning of stands
- Eradication not possible
- Stump protection, frequently borax but also other chemicals such as urea
- Avoid high-risk sites and treat frequently there, such as deep, well-drained sandy soils.
- Biocontrol fungi can be used to prevent colonization of *Heterobasidion annosum*
- Note that wider spacing designed to reduce need to thin conflicts with the need for dense stands to prevent fusiform rust.
- Thin during summer when spore production is low.
- Prescribed fire in understory can reduce mortality and infection, exacly why is unkown, possibly to to positive effects on competetive fungi
- Destumping expensive but useful in areas where decomposition is slow (e.g., England)
- Soil risk rating to determine which control meaures neccessary,  but varies by species

# Laminated Root Disease

## Hosts

 - Parasitizes Douglas fir and western hemlock, and most conifers in PNW are susceptible.
 - Causes redoced size of crown, yellowing foliage and small cones.  Root collar may be covered with mycelia.  Red-brown irregular or crescent stain on the stump.  Eventually, pitted, laminated woods.
 
## Pathogen

 - *Phellinus weirri* cuases the disease

## Epidemiology

 - Most infections originate from roots and stumps already present in the area, as organisms can survive decades in stumps.  
 - Spread is by root contact, so disease occurs in exapnding infectious patches.  Some infection of wind-blown basidiospores into stumps, though less common.
 - Even resistant trees may have fungus in heartwood and be source of innoculum as they continue to repace roots that are infected

## Control

 - Stategies for removal include stump removal, high-nitrogen fertilization, chemical agents, and species manipulation
 - Locate infection centers during harvest and pull out stumps and adhering soil
 - Deep (~60 cm) root raking
 - Heavy N fertilization with urea promotes competitive fungi
 - Surround infection center with barrier of resistant species (esp. N-fixers) at least 30m.  Multiple rotations (60-80 yrs), may be required before re-planing susceptible Douglas-fir.

# Amrmillaia Root Disease

 - Worldwide distribution, very wide host range
 - Aggressive pathogen in US Western forest, mostly a secondary infection on stressed trees in the East
 - Not epidemic, but large scale deaths may occu following drought

## Pathogen

 - About 55 described species under *Armillaria*, but roughly 6 distinct taxa in North America

## Biology and Epidemiology

 - Attacks root systems, but success very dependent on host condition and innoculum pressure.  More often grows as saprophyte on dead wood, or cause non-lethal heart decay.  
 - Grows between roots in close contact.
 - In dry interior West, can attack and kill healhty trees of all ages.  Iinfection associated with harvesting operations but also in virgin forest.
 - Since pathogen grows even better on dead wood, stumps act as sources of innoculum
 - Stumps act as high quality "food base" which allows rhizomorphs to overcome host resistance in adjacent live roots

## Control

 - Identify diseased trees at time of harvest by examining stimps
 - Stump removal


## Dwarf Mistletoe

- Major problem on pondersoa pine,also lodgepole, Doug-fir, other western conifers.  Black spruce in the Lake states. 
- Results in mortality, growth reduction, poor quality, breakage and predisposition to decay and attack by other pathogens/insects
- Effect is gradual

## Pathogen

 - 40 species of dwarf mistletoes (Genus *Arceuthobium*)
 - Seeds are one-seeded berries, with mucus around seeds.  Expelled forcibly several meters, also dispersed by birds
 - Seeds can photosynthesize to survive long periods
 - Stick to needles, slide down to bark in the rain and germinate on leaf node or other irregularity
 - Root (haustorium) penetrates bark and connects with host xylem
 - Mistletoes photosynthesize but derive most nutrition from host
 - 4-5 years required for new seeds
 - Some species sprout new shoots from extensive root network outside the host cambium (e.g., *A. pusillum, on black spruce)
 - Requires a lot of light, most comon in open stands and upper branches
 - Spread is slow (<1 m per year), More rapid spread down than up, more rapid through open stands due to vigor from light seed dispersal distance
 - Hard to detect in many trees - aerial photography often useful

## Control

 - Fire previously was a control
 - Eradication of host locally is possible, combined with fire is very effective
 - Cut 20-40m beyond known edge of infection 
 - Use natural barriers
 - Nonsusceptible host barrier can help if eradication not complete
 - If eradication not possible, slow spread
 - Clear heavily infested trees from overstory when planting susceptibles
 - Pruning possible but needs be repreated at 3-4 year intervals at high-value recreation sites
 - In young stands, tree removal/pruning.  Thin the infected trees before the non-infected ones
 - In old stands, sometimes better to just leave it until harvest so as not to lose timber value.  Optimization issue here
