  abstract	= {California bay laurel trees (Umbellularia californica)
		  play a crucial role in the reproduction and survival of
		  Phytophthora ramorum in coastal California forests by
		  supporting sporulation during the rainy season and by
		  providing a means for the pathogen to survive the dry,
		  Mediterranean summer. While bay laurel is thus critical to
		  the epidemiology of sudden oak death and other P. ramorum
		  diseases in California, the relatively minor symptoms
		  observed on this reservoir host suggest that it may not
		  sustain ecologically significant injury itself. The
		  long-term role that P. ramorum will play in California
		  forests will depend in part on the extent to which this
		  pathogen decreases the ecological fitness of bay laurel.
		  Despite the importance of this question, no study has yet
		  investigated in detail the physiological impact that
		  ramorum blight imposes on bay laurel. This experimental
		  study quantifies the impact that P. ramorum has on
		  artificially inoculated bay laurel seedlings with
		  measurements that integrate the full injury that infection
		  with an oomycete may cause: photosynthetic efficiency,
		  total photosynthetic area, and growth. Leaf area and leaf
		  mass were not impacted significantly by infection of P.
		  ramorum. Photosynthetic efficiency was mildly depressed in
		  symptomatic, but not asymptomatic leaves, despite
		  unnaturally high levels of necrosis that were imposed on
		  the seedlings. These results demonstrate that bay laurel
		  trees suffer only minor injury from ramorum blight beyond
		  visible necrotic symptoms. Consequently, it is highly
		  likely that bay laurel will continue to be widely available
		  as a host for P. ramorum in California forests, which has
		  long-term implications for the composition of these
		  forests.},

		  illustrate the practical applications of epidemiological

  abstract	= {Heterogeneities in transmission among hosts can be very
		  important in shaping infectious disease dynamics. In
		  mammals with strong social organization, such
		  heterogeneities are often structured by functional stage:
		  juveniles, subadults and adults. We investigate the
		  importance of such stage-related heterogeneities in shaping
		  the 2002 phocine distemper virus (PDV) outbreak in the
		  Dutch Wadden Sea, when more than 40 per cent of the harbour
		  seals were killed. We do this by comparing the statistical
		  fit of a hierarchy of models with varying transmission
		  complexity: homogeneous versus heterogeneous mixing and
		  density- versus frequency-dependent transmission. We use
		  the stranding data as a proxy for incidence and use Poisson
		  likelihoods to estimate the 'who acquires infection from
		  whom' (WAIFW) matrix. Statistically, the model with strong
		  heterogeneous mixing and density-dependent transmission was
		  found to best describe the transmission dynamics. However,
		  patterns of incidence support a model of
		  frequency-dependent transmission among adults and
		  juveniles. Based on the maximum-likelihood WAIFW matrix
		  estimates, we use the next-generation formalism to
		  calculate an R(0) between 2 and 2.5 for the Dutch 2002 PDV
		  epidemic.},

  abstract	= {Alpine tree-line ecotones are characterized by marked
		  changes at small spatial scales that may result in a
		  variety of physiognomies. A set of alternative
		  individual-based models was tested with data from four
		  contrasting Pinus uncinata ecotones in the central Spanish
		  Pyrenees to reveal the minimal subset of processes required
		  for tree-line formation. A Bayesian approach combined with
		  Markov chain Monte Carlo methods was employed to obtain the
		  posterior distribution of model parameters, allowing the
		  use of model selection procedures. The main features of
		  real tree lines emerged only in models considering
		  nonlinear responses in individual rates of growth or
		  mortality with respect to the altitudinal gradient.
		  Variation in tree-line physiognomy reflected mainly changes
		  in the relative importance of these nonlinear responses,
		  while other processes, such as dispersal limitation and
		  facilitation, played a secondary role. Different nonlinear
		  responses also determined the presence or absence of
		  krummholz, in agreement with recent findings highlighting a
		  different response of diffuse and abrupt or krummholz tree
		  lines to climate change. The method presented here can be
		  widely applied in individual-based simulation models and
		  will turn model selection and evaluation in this type of
		  models into a more transparent, effective, and efficient
		  exercise.},

@Article{	  Wood2010,
  abstract	= {Chaotic ecological dynamic systems defy conventional
		  statistical analysis. Systems with near-chaotic dynamics
		  are little better. Such systems are almost invariably
		  driven by endogenous dynamic processes plus demographic and
		  environmental process noise, and are only observable with
		  error. Their sensitivity to history means that minute
		  changes in the driving noise realization, or the system
		  parameters, will cause drastic changes in the system
		  trajectory. This sensitivity is inherited and amplified by
		  the joint probability density of the observable data and
		  the process noise, rendering it useless as the basis for
		  obtaining measures of statistical fit. Because the joint
		  density is the basis for the fit measures used by all
		  conventional statistical methods, this is a major
		  theoretical shortcoming. The inability to make well-founded
		  statistical inferences about biological dynamic models in
		  the chaotic and near-chaotic regimes, other than on an ad
		  hoc basis, leaves dynamic theory without the methods of
		  quantitative validation that are essential tools in the
		  rest of biological science. Here I show that this impasse
		  can be resolved in a simple and general manner, using a
		  method that requires only the ability to simulate the
		  observed data on a system from the dynamic model about
		  which inferences are required. The raw data series are
		  reduced to phase-insensitive summary statistics,
		  quantifying local dynamic structure and the distribution of
		  observations. Simulation is used to obtain the mean and the
		  covariance matrix of the statistics, given model
		  parameters, allowing the construction of a 'synthetic
		  likelihood' that assesses model fit. This likelihood can be
		  explored using a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo
		  sampler, but one further post-processing step returns pure
		  likelihood-based inference. I apply the method to establish
		  the dynamic nature of the fluctuations in Nicholson's
		  classic blowfly experiments.},
