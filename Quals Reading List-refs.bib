  abstract	= {Preventing the establishment of invading pest species can
		  be beneficial with respect to averting future environmental
		  and economic impacts and also in preventing the
		  accumulation of control costs. Allee effects play an
		  important role in the dynamics of newly established,
		  low-density populations by driving small populations into
		  self-extinction, making Allee effects critical in
		  influencing outcomes of eradication efforts. We consider
		  interactions between management tactics in the presence of
		  Allee effects to determine cost-effective and
		  time-efficient combinations to achieve eradication by
		  developing a model that considers pesticide application,
		  predator augmentation and mating disruption as control
		  tactics, using the gypsy moth as a case study. Our findings
		  indicate that given a range of constant expenditure levels,
		  applying moderate levels of pesticides in conjunction with
		  mating disruption increases the Allee threshold which
		  simultaneously substantially decreases the time to
		  eradication relative to either tactic alone. In contrast,
		  increasing predation in conjunction with other tactics
		  requires larger economic expenditures to achieve similar
		  outcomes for the use of pesticide application or mating
		  disruption alone. These results demonstrate the beneficial
		  synergy that may arise from nonlinearities associated with
		  the simultaneous application of multiple eradication
		  tactics and offer new prospects for preventing the
		  establishment of damaging non-native species.},

		  epidemiological concepts for the invasion and persistence
		  of plant pathogens. An overarching modeling framework is
		  then presented that can be used to analyze disease invasion
		  and persistence at a range of scales from the microscopic
		  to the regional. Criteria for invasion and persistence are
		  introduced, initially for simple models of epidemics, and
		  then for models with greater biological realism. Some ways
		  in which epidemiological models are used to identify
		  optimal strategies for the control of disease are
		  discussed. Particular attention is given to the spatial
		  structure of host populations and to the role of chance
		  events in determining invasion and persistence of plant
		  pathogens. Finally, three brief case studies are used to
		  illustrate the practical applications of epidemiological
		  theory to understand invasion and persistence of plant
		  pathogens. These comprise long-term predictions for the
		  persistence and control of Dutch elm disease;
		  identification of methods to manage the spread of

		  experimental investigation have always marched together.
		  Mathematics has been less intrusive in the life sciences,
		  possibly because they have until recently been largely
		  descriptive, lacking the invariance principles and
		  fundamental natural constants of physics. Increasingly in
		  recent decades, however, mathematics has become pervasive
		  in biology, taking many different forms: statistics in
		  experimental design; pattern seeking in bioinformatics;
		  models in evolution, ecology, and epidemiology; and much
		  else. I offer an opinionated overview of such uses--and

		  substantial contributions to public health, particularly

		  models both demographic and epidemiological transitions;
		  (ii) parameterizing the framework, where parameters may be

		  infection, basic patterns of human demography, specific
		  characteristics of population growth, and details of
		  vaccination regimes implemented; (iii) evaluating public
		  health strategies in the face of changing human demography.
		  We illustrate the general approach by developing a model of

@Article{	  Moore2011a,
  abstract	= {Many generalist pathogens are influenced by the spatial
		  distributions and relative abundances of susceptible host
		  species. The spatial structure of host populations can
		  influence patterns of infection incidence (or disease
		  outbreaks), and the effects of a generalist pathogen on
		  host community dynamics in a spatially heterogeneous
		  community may differ from predictions derived via simple
		  models. In this paper, we model the transmission of a
		  generalist pathogen within a patch framework that
		  incorporates the movement of vectors between discrete host
		  patches to investigate the effects of local host community
		  composition and vector movement rates on disease
		  dynamics.We use barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses
		  (B/CYDV), a suite of generalist, aphid-vectored pathogens
		  of grasses, and their interactions with a range of host
		  species as our case study. We examine whether B/CYDV can
		  persist locally or in a patch framework across a range of
		  host community configurations. We then determine how
		  pathogen-mediated interactions between perennial and annual
		  competitors are altered at the local and regional scale
		  when the host populations are spatially structured. We find
		  that the spatial configuration of the patch system, host
		  composition within patches, and patch connectivity affect
		  not only the ability of the pathogen to invade a fragmented
		  system, but also determine whether the pathogen facilitates
		  the invasion of a non-native host species. Further, our
		  results suggest that connectivity can interact with arrival
		  time and host infection tolerance to determine the success
		  or failure of establishment for newly arriving species.},

@Article{	  Seabloom2009,
  abstract	= {Most species host multiple pathogens, yet field studies
		  rarely examine the processes determining pathogen diversity
		  within a single host or the effects of coinfection on
		  pathogen dynamics in natural systems. Coinfection can
		  affect pathogen transmission and virulence. In turn,
		  coinfection can be regulated within hosts by interactions
		  such as cross-protective immunity or at broader spatial
		  scales via vector distributions. Using a general model, we
		  demonstrate that coinfection by a group of vectored
		  pathogens is highest with abundant generalist vectors and
		  weak cross-protection and coinfection-induced mortality.
		  Using these predictions, we investigate the distribution of
		  five coexisting aphid-vectored, viral pathogens (barley and
		  cereal yellow dwarf luteoviruses and poleroviruses) in a
		  native perennial grass (Elymus glaucus) in both space (700
		  km) and time (4 years). Observed coinfection rates were
		  much higher than expected at random, suggesting that
		  within-host processes exerted weak effects on within-host
		  pathogen diversity. Covariance among viruses in space and
		  time was highest for viral species sharing a vector.
		  Temporal correlation arose from the synchronous invasion of
		  two viruses transmitted by a shared aphid species. On the
		  basis of our modeling and empirical results, we expect that
		  factors external to individual hosts may affect the
		  coinfection dynamics in other communities hosting vectored
		  pathogens.},
