  abstract	= {Preventing the establishment of invading pest species can
		  be beneficial with respect to averting future environmental
		  and economic impacts and also in preventing the
		  accumulation of control costs. Allee effects play an
		  important role in the dynamics of newly established,
		  low-density populations by driving small populations into
		  self-extinction, making Allee effects critical in
		  influencing outcomes of eradication efforts. We consider
		  interactions between management tactics in the presence of
		  Allee effects to determine cost-effective and
		  time-efficient combinations to achieve eradication by
		  developing a model that considers pesticide application,
		  predator augmentation and mating disruption as control
		  tactics, using the gypsy moth as a case study. Our findings
		  indicate that given a range of constant expenditure levels,
		  applying moderate levels of pesticides in conjunction with
		  mating disruption increases the Allee threshold which
		  simultaneously substantially decreases the time to
		  eradication relative to either tactic alone. In contrast,
		  increasing predation in conjunction with other tactics
		  requires larger economic expenditures to achieve similar
		  outcomes for the use of pesticide application or mating
		  disruption alone. These results demonstrate the beneficial
		  synergy that may arise from nonlinearities associated with
		  the simultaneous application of multiple eradication
		  tactics and offer new prospects for preventing the
		  establishment of damaging non-native species.},

		  To date, disease has never been quantitatively assessed as

		  Although pathogen-induced reversal of a competitive

  abstract	= {Cost-effective surveillance strategies are needed for
		  efficient responses to biological invasions and must
		  account for the trade-offs between surveillance effort and

		  increasing the costs of damages and control. In addition,
		  surveillance strategies are usually applied in environments
		  under continual invasion pressure where the number, size

		  accounts for these features of the decision and invasion
		  environment and determines the long term sampling effort
		  that minimises the total expected costs of new invasions.
		  The optimal solution depends on population establishment
		  and growth rates, sample sensitivity, and sample,

		  optimise surveillance systems under budgetary constraints
		  and find that accounting for spatial heterogeneity in

		  epidemiological concepts for the invasion and persistence
		  of plant pathogens. An overarching modeling framework is
		  then presented that can be used to analyze disease invasion
		  and persistence at a range of scales from the microscopic
		  to the regional. Criteria for invasion and persistence are
		  introduced, initially for simple models of epidemics, and
		  then for models with greater biological realism. Some ways

		  optimal strategies for the control of disease are
		  discussed. Particular attention is given to the spatial
		  structure of host populations and to the role of chance
		  events in determining invasion and persistence of plant
		  pathogens. Finally, three brief case studies are used to
		  illustrate the practical applications of epidemiological
		  theory to understand invasion and persistence of plant
		  pathogens. These comprise long-term predictions for the
		  persistence and control of Dutch elm disease;
		  identification of methods to manage the spread of
		  rhizomania on sugar beet in the U.K. by matching the scale

		  Most existing inference methods place substantial
		  restrictions upon the form of models that can be fitted and
		  hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses that can
		  be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate
		  them. In contrast, the so-called plug-and-play methods
		  require only simulations from a model and are thus free of
		  such restrictions. We show the utility of the plug-and-play
		  approach in the context of an investigation of measles
		  transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to
		  ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been
		  unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that
		  plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling
		  and inference framework applicable to data from both large
		  and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights
		  into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on
		  the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity
		  as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and
		  model misspecification. Our approach is readily applicable
		  to many other epidemiological and ecological systems.},

		  affect pathogen transmission and virulence. In turn,

		  scales via vector distributions. Using a general model, we
		  demonstrate that coinfection by a group of vectored

		  Using these predictions, we investigate the distribution of

		  native perennial grass (Elymus glaucus) in both space (700
		  km) and time (4 years). Observed coinfection rates were
		  much higher than expected at random, suggesting that

		  Temporal correlation arose from the synchronous invasion of
