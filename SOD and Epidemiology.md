SOD occurs in forest systems that are structured in several important ways

First, multiple species.  They have differing disease characteristics

Second, stage structure.  Trees have been shown to have different epidemiological characteristics across size classes

Third, spatial structure.  As trees are stationary, their contact structure can not be assumed to be well-mixed.

Literature has explored, individually, the effects of each of these population structures

Multiple species (Dobson)

Age (@Anderson1985) and stage (@Klepac2009)

Spatial structure (@Park2001; @Park2002; @Brown2004a), including metapopulations and clumping in continuous space

 - Both of these find a distinction betweeen long- and short- distance dispersal, and that spread can be checked by spatial structure, sometimes accellerated with moderate clumping on the scale of dispersal

My question:  What are the most important parts of population structure to use in predicting the spread of SOD in forests?

How do we consider these jointly?

What's the most parsimonious model that represents the data?
