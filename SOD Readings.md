Some literature on Sudden Oak Death

@Rizzo2005
==========

Summary
-------

-   SOD management occurs at many scales, but the stand/landscape scale is the
    most complex
-   It occurs in a wide range of forests that include coast live oak and tanoak
-   It has a mostly clonal population structure, with some differences between
    NA and Europe
-   Bay Laurel presence, historic path of infection, and stand structure affect
    probability of disease
-   Dispersal is wind driven, mostly from leaves of canopy trees. Occurs in
    rainy season
-   Major mortality impacts on oak and tanoak, but variation in susceptibility
    at individual level
-   Management span, monitoring, diagnosis, eradication, stand manipulation,
    fungicides, quarantine and restoration.

Introduction
------------

-   Sudden oak death first observed as causing bleeding stem cankers and death
    in tanoak and coast live oak in 1990s
-   Found in N. America, Europe, hosts in 40+ genera, though mortality limited
    to *Fagaceae*

Levels and Complexity of Management
-----------------------------------

-   Tree, stand/landscaoe, and regional/international levels
-   At individual level, focus is on chemical control, lowering inoculum
    pressure
    -   Homeowners, arborists, urban-wildland interface and aesthetic/historic
        value
    -   Phosphate treatments (injection and spray) best if preventative

-   Regional/international management aimed to prevent further spread
    -   Quarantine on nursery industries
    -   Wide host range makes difficult

-   Stand/landscape mgmt most difficult
    -   Previous atttempts removing host material in in chestnut blight, white
        pine blister rust, dutch elm, *Phytophthori cinnamomi* and *P.
        lateralis*. Results mixed

-   Decision-making is complex. SOD exists in highly varied socio-ecological
    landscape.
-   Need to determine management goals in absence of SOD first. Timber is often
    not priority.
-   Prevention, treatment, restoration, and convervation must be integrated

Invaded Forests of California and Oregon
----------------------------------------

-   SOD found in forests that include oak and tonoak as structural component:
-   With and without Douglas-fir
-   Many evergreen broad-leaved sclerophyllus (thick-leaved) trees and shrubs
-   Hardwood associates include Bay Laurel, Pacific madrone, bigleaf maple
-   Often in redwood forests with shrubs like rhododendron, huckleberry
-   Fire and logging affect forest structure. Tanoak and Coast live oak sprout
    from roots following logging/fire, are often overtopped in later succession.
    Horizonal structure is often very fine-scaled.

Pathogen Characterization
-------------------------

-   Geographic origin unknown, exotic to Europe and N. America
-   Monophyletic group, with distinct European and American clades
    -   N. American versions seem to be primarily one clonal lineage, European
        many closly related types
    -   Some evidence of continued exchange between European and American (A1
        and A2) populations

-   Not sexually generated pop. genetic structure - mostly mutation and mitotic
    recombination
-   High variation in virulence, both between and within genotypes, indicating
    plasticity. Virulence level correlated across hosts. Most virulent
    populations are A2 isolates from wild
-   Variation in resistnace to fungicides. European strains developing
    resistance to Metalaxyl, common in nursery settings

*P. Ramoroum* in Forests
------------------------

### Spatial Distribution

-   Found from Big Sur to Curry County, OR. Mostly within 30km of coast or SF
    Bay.
-   Patchy at many scales. Similarity of sites with different diease status
    suggest historical rather than environmental driver of patchiness.
-   Bay laurel the greatest predictor of disease across forests, esp. in
    mixed-evergreen forest dominated by coast live oak.
-   Foliar hosts (e.g. Bay Laurel) precede oak bark infection, but not in tanoak
    forests, where tanoak twigs/eaves can be infected. Little Bay Laurel in OR
    infected forests.
-   Density, slope, etc. not good predictors of disease. Canopy exposure, edge
    effects more important. Positive disease association with water status, tree
    drought stress not important.

### Host Resistance

-   Trees display variation in susceptibility at individal level at all aptial
    scales.
-   More population-level patterns in Bay Laurel than oak species

### Sporulation and Survival Patterns

-   Sporangia produced on leaves (and small twigs on Tanoak) following rainfall.
    No sporulation directly from bleeding cankers.
-   Sporulation/infection restricted to rainy season in Mediterranean climates.
    Temp/moisture relationships complex. Sporulation commencement relative to
    start of rainy season varies across forests, perhaps due to level of
    dessication in dry months. Significant inter-annual variation.
-   Propugules travel \~10-20m from infected tree, depending on height. More
    infection of oaks in less-dense stands, possibly due to lower wind speed.
-   No evidence of lateral spread in understory
-   Dispersal is long-tailed, sugesting occaisional long-distance dispersal

Determination of Impacts
------------------------

-   Doubles mortality of Coast Live Oak, quadruples tanoak.
-   Spreads very quickly within a stand
-   Cascading ecological effects
    -   Altered competition between plant species
    -   Syngergism with other fungal (decay) pathogens and wind-driven
        mortality.
    -   Increased woody debris, change in nutrient cycling

Management Actions
------------------

See Table 2 in paper for research finding-management actions links

### Monitoring

### Diagnosis

-   Culture-based diagnosis dependent on environment, leads to false negatives
-   Molecular assys better, but depends on part of plant tested

### Eradication

-   Possible at early stages of invasion
    -   Requires intensive survey, quaratine, cut, burning stump treatment

-   Adaptive management to adjust buffer area, pre-emptive removal of hosts

### Stand manupulation

-   Removal of infected plants
-   Increasing interhost distance (but lower density may lead to more wind
    disperal)
-   Pruning branches may lessen load without major ecological community effects

### Fire

-   Historical fire regimes in these forest highly variable and uncertain
-   Both understory and stand-replacing fires may increase tanoak
-   Smoke may kill foliar SOD

### Fungicides

-   Phosphites injected, or applied to bark and leaves are effective. Soil
    treatments not
-   Large-scale treatment very expensive, difficult to target the patchy
    distribution of disease

### Prevention of Human Spread

-   Surveillance and quarantine of ornamental nursery stock
-   Possibilities in soil, waste, stream water

### Restoration

-   Possibility of introducing less-vulnerable tree variants
-   Historic baseline often unknown
-   Decadal restoration process

### Conculusions

-   Forests with hosts may be vulnerable in British Columbia, other parts of
    world. Actual risk depend on climate, species composition and forest
    structure

@Ellis2010 - Spatial Pattern and Connectivity
=============================================

Summary
-------

SOD severity is best predicted by a combination of environmental
(biotic/abiotic) variables and connectivity to other areas of disease.
Connectivity is not based strictly on physical dispersal distance, but on the
effective distance based on the difficulty of the disease moving through patches
of different host density or presence.

The effective dispersal distance calculation depends a lot on the scale of
dispersal and the scale of examination here.

*Personal note: You need a table to compare model structures and results. Text
description is terrible*

Introduction
------------

-   Three types of connectivity
    -   *Structural* - physical aspects of landscape
    -   *Potential* - landscape + dispersal ability
    -   *Actual* - empirically derivd=ed

-   Key question: When is connectivity important in dynamics and when can it be
    ignored?
    -   Can be evaluated by relative importance of environmental and
        connectivity variables

-   Study tests relative importance of connectivity in determining spatial
    distribution of SOD
    -   Also test whether results are sensitive to method of measurement

-   *Hypothesis 1*: Potntial connectivity is important in determining spatial
    distribution of SOD
-   *Hypothesis 2*: Connectivity is better characterized when it includes
    landscape structure
-   *Hypotesis 3*: Connectivity and environmental variables equal in influence

Methods
-------

-   Data from 86 Plots in Sonoma County in 2005. Randonly established in host
    woodlands. Forest info and disease severity meaured in each. Map of land
    cover generated from aerial imagery.
-   Compared models of spread though simple Euclidean distance to effective
    distance (least-cost path based on friction assigned to each land cover
    type)
-   Model structure was $$Y_i = \beta_0 + \sum \beta_j X_j + \beta_9 \lambda_i$$
    Where $Y_i$ was disease incidence (sympotomatic leaves/stem), $X$ are
    environmental variables and $\lambda$ is the spore burden based on a
    negative-expotential dispersal kernel from all other points, via Euclidean
    or effective distance, weighted by disease level at other sites.
-   Environmental variables were canopy cover, precipitation, ave. daily hours
    at optimal temp and humidity for pathogen growth, potenital irraadiation,
    moisture index, bay laurel total DBH, total host DBH
-   Friction was 1 for cells with hosts, tested varied scenarios for non-host
    cells
-   Stepwise regression: First fit dispersal kernel for each friction scenario,
    then fit rest of model
-   Determined best fit using 9 selection methods in SAS. Picked top models that
    were selected consistently and compared via BIC/AIC
-   Calculated standardized regression coeffficients

Results
-------

-   Models with both connectivity and environment peformed best
-   Models with effective distance performed better than Euclidean
-   Best fit models had connectivity of mid-level importance among environmental
    variables of varying importance
-   Best fit model had mid-level friction values for non-host landscapes,
    indicating that non-host environments sometimes did carry disease

# @Grunwald2012 - Emergence of SOD

## Biology

 - *P. ramorum* is a water mold, most closely related to brown algae and diatoms
 - Has both asexual and sexual phase.  Asexual spores are chlamydospres (dormant, resistant to adverse conditions), and sporangia (can germinate or go motile)
 - Sexual reproduction rare, mating types do not often interact
 - Sporangia splash-disperse from leaves and twigs.  Zoospores released from sporangia, then germinate and penetrate host.  Rapid life cycling under good conditions.  Many chlamydospres produced, too.
 -  Hosts in > 100 species, 40 genera
 -  Symptoms: necrotic foliar leisions, shhot dieback, or bleeding cankers on stem (discolored phloem and xylem, declining sap/hydraulic flow).  Both sympoms in tanoak

## Repeated emergence

- Three clonal lineages, EU1, NA1, NA2, with all three present in N. America and only the first in Europe.
-  NA1 introduced in nursery plants in Scotts Valley, CA, in late 20th century, probably had human-assisted dispersal to local wld forest.  Spread through the nursery trade across the U.S.
-  EU1 site of origin in Europe unclear, but found mostly in nurseries/gardens and in UK larch plantations.  Later introduced to Pacific Northwest, reached CA.
-  NA2 first found in BC or Washington, unknown source.
-  Strains are diverging and evolving, but no evidence of selection
-  Eradication unlikely
-  Repeated emergence due to wide host range, favorable nursery environment
-  Clonal lines likely descended from sexual population (have high heterozygosity), that co-evolved with hosts for a long time.  Location unknown
-  Mutations indicate that clonal lines are >100,000 yrs old.  Clonal lines are poorly compatible, probably were separate before their introduction, come from separate source populations

## Genetics

 - All clonal lines are of one mating type (~gender), so no sexual production.  A few of other mater type of EU1 found, but eradicated.
 -  No natural recombinants detected, artifically induced ones have reduced pathogenicity, reduced chromosome number, and reduced growth rates.  This is consistent with *Phytophthora cinnamomi*.
 
## Other *Phytophthora* species

- Other *Phytophthora* species are pathogenic.  Many more species have been discovered in recent years.
- Among pathogenic species, most are clonal lines with little diversity, suggesting introduction to new hosts is what causes disease emergence, rather than recombination
-  However, species hybrids have been found and some have expanded host ranges.
