Some literature on Sudden Oak Death

@Rizzo2005
==========

Summary
-------

-  SOD management occurs at many scales, but the stand/landscape scale is the most complex
-  It occurs in a wide range of forests that include coast live oak and tanoak
-  It has a mostly clonal population structure, with some differences between NA and Europe
-  Bay Laurel presence, historic path of infection, and stand structure affect probability of disease
-  Dispersal is wind driven, mostly from leaves of canopy trees.  Occurs in rainy season
-  Major mortality impacts on oak and tanoak, but variation in susceptibility at individual level
-  Management span, monitoring, diagnosis, eradication, stand manipulation, fungicides, quarantine and restoration.

Introduction
------------

-   Sudden oak death first observed as causing bleeding stem cankers and death
    in tanoak and coast live oak in 1990s
-   Found in N. America, Europe, hosts in 40+ genera, though mortality limited
    to *Fagaceae*

Levels and Complexity of Management
-----------------------------------

-   Tree, stand/landscaoe, and regional/international levels
-   At individual level, focus is on chemical control, lowering inoculum
    pressure
    -   Homeowners, arborists, urban-wildland interface and aesthetic/historic
        value
    -   Phosphate treatments (injection and spray) best if preventative

-   Regional/international management aimed to prevent further spread
    -   Quarantine on nursery industries
    -   Wide host range makes difficult

-   Stand/landscape mgmt most difficult
    -   Previous atttempts removing host material in in chestnut blight, white
        pine blister rust, dutch elm, *Phytophthori cinnamomi* and *P.
        lateralis*. Results mixed

-   Decision-making is complex. SOD exists in highly varied socio-ecological
    landscape.
-   Need to determine management goals in absence of SOD first. Timber is often
    not priority.
-   Prevention, treatment, restoration, and convervation must be integrated

Invaded Forests of California and Oregon
----------------------------------------

-   SOD found in forests that include oak and tonoak as structural component:
-   With and without Douglas-fir
-   Many evergreen broad-leaved sclerophyllus (thick-leaved) trees and shrubs
-   Hardwood associates include Bay Laurel, Pacific madrone, bigleaf maple
-   Often in redwood forests with shrubs like rhododendron, huckleberry
-   Fire and logging affect forest structure. Tanoak and Coast live oak sprout
    from roots following logging/fire, are often overtopped in later succession.
    Horizonal structure is often very fine-scaled.

Pathogen Characterization
-------------------------

-   Geographic origin unknown, exotic to Europe and N. America
-   Monophyletic group, with distinct European and American clades
    -   N. American versions seem to be primarily one clonal lineage, European
        many closly related types
    -   Some evidence of continued exchange between European and American (A1
        and A2) populations

-   Not sexually generated pop. genetic structure - mostly mutation and mitotic
    recombination
-   High variation in virulence, both between and within genotypes, indicating
    plasticity. Virulence level correlated across hosts. Most virulent
    populations are A2 isolates from wild
-   Variation in resistnace to fungicides. European strains developing
    resistance to Metalaxyl, common in nursery settings

### Spatial Distribution

-   Found from Big Sur to Curry County, OR. Mostly within 30km of coast or SF
    Bay.
-   Patchy at many scales. Similarity of sites with different diease status
    suggest historical rather than environmental driver of patchiness.
-   Bay laurel the greatest predictor of disease across forests, esp. in
    mixed-evergreen forest dominated by coast live oak.
-   Foliar hosts (e.g. Bay Laurel) precede oak bark infection, but not in tanoak
    forests, where tanoak twigs/eaves can be infected. Little Bay Laurel in OR
    infected forests.
-   Density, slope, etc. not good predictors of disease. Canopy exposure, edge
    effects more important. Positive disease association with water status, tree
    drought stress not important.

### Host Resistance

-   Trees display variation in susceptibility at individal level at all aptial scales.
-   More population-level patterns in Bay Laurel than oak species

### Sporulation and Survival Patterns

-  Sporangia produced on leaves (and small twigs on Tanoak) following rainfall.  No sporulation directly from bleeding cankers.
-   Sporulation/infection restricted to rainy season in Mediterranean climates.  Temp/moisture relationships complex.  Sporulation commencement relative to start of rainy season varies across forests, perhaps due to level of dessication in dry months.  Significant inter-annual variation.
-   Propugules travel ~10-20m from infected tree, depending on height.  More infection of oaks in less-dense stands, possibly due to lower wind speed.
-   No evidence of lateral spread in understory
-   Dispersal is long-tailed, sugesting occaisional long-distance dispersal

## Determination of Impacts

-   Doubles mortality of Coast Live Oak, quadruples tanoak.
-   Spreads very quickly within a stand
-   Cascading ecological effects
    -   Altered competition between plant species
    -   Syngergism with other fungal (decay) pathogens and wind-driven mortality.
    -   Increased woody debris, change in nutrient cycling
    
## Management Actions

See Table 2 in paper for research finding-management actions links

### Monitoring

### Diagnosis

-   Culture-based diagnosis dependent on environment, leads to false negatives
-   Molecular assys better, but depends on part of plant tested

### Eradication

-   Possible at early stages of invasion
    - Requires intensive survey, quaratine, cut, burning stump treatment
-   Adaptive management to adjust buffer area, pre-emptive removal of hosts

### Stand manupulation

-   Removal of infected plants
-   Increasing interhost distance (but lower density may lead to more wind disperal)
-   Pruning branches may lessen load without major ecological community effects

### Fire

-   Historical fire regimes in these forest highly variable and uncertain
-   Both understory and stand-replacing fires may increase tanoak
-   Smoke may kill foliar SOD

### Fungicides

-   Phosphites injected, or applied to bark and leaves are effective. Soil treatments not
-   Large-scale treatment very expensive, difficult to target the patchy distribution of disease

### Prevention of Human Spread

-   Surveillance and quarantine of ornamental nursery stock
-   Possibilities in soil, waste, stream water

### Restoration

-   Possibility of introducing less-vulnerable tree variants
-   Historic baseline often unknown
-   Decadal restoration process

### Conculusions

-  Forests with hosts may be vulnerable in British Columbia, other parts of world.  Actual risk depend on climate, species composition and forest structure
