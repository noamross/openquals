  abstract	= {California bay laurel trees (Umbellularia californica)
		  play a crucial role in the reproduction and survival of
		  Phytophthora ramorum in coastal California forests by
		  supporting sporulation during the rainy season and by
		  providing a means for the pathogen to survive the dry,
		  Mediterranean summer. While bay laurel is thus critical to
		  the epidemiology of sudden oak death and other P. ramorum
		  diseases in California, the relatively minor symptoms
		  observed on this reservoir host suggest that it may not
		  sustain ecologically significant injury itself. The
		  long-term role that P. ramorum will play in California
		  forests will depend in part on the extent to which this
		  pathogen decreases the ecological fitness of bay laurel.
		  Despite the importance of this question, no study has yet
		  investigated in detail the physiological impact that
		  ramorum blight imposes on bay laurel. This experimental
		  study quantifies the impact that P. ramorum has on
		  artificially inoculated bay laurel seedlings with
		  measurements that integrate the full injury that infection
		  with an oomycete may cause: photosynthetic efficiency,
		  total photosynthetic area, and growth. Leaf area and leaf
		  mass were not impacted significantly by infection of P.
		  ramorum. Photosynthetic efficiency was mildly depressed in
		  symptomatic, but not asymptomatic leaves, despite
		  unnaturally high levels of necrosis that were imposed on
		  the seedlings. These results demonstrate that bay laurel
		  trees suffer only minor injury from ramorum blight beyond
		  visible necrotic symptoms. Consequently, it is highly
		  likely that bay laurel will continue to be widely available
		  as a host for P. ramorum in California forests, which has
		  long-term implications for the composition of these
		  forests.},
