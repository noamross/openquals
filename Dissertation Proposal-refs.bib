		  Phytophthora ramorum, the causal agent of sudden oak death,
		  was studied in mixed- evergreen forest, a common forest
		  type in northern, coastal California. Investigation of the
		  sources of spore production focused on coast live oak
		  (Quercus agrifolia) and bay laurel (Umbellularia
		  californica), dominant hosts that comprised 39.7 and 46.2\%
		  of the individuals at the study site, respectively. All
		  tests for inoculum production from the surface of in-
		  fected coast live oak bark or exudates from cankers were
		  negative. In con- trast, sporangia and chlamydospores were
		  produced on the surface of in- fected bay laurel leaves.
		  Mean number of zoospores produced from infected bay laurel
		  leaves under natural field conditions during rainstorms was
		  1,173.0 ± SE 301.48, and ranged as high as 5,200
		  spores/leaf. P. ramorum was recovered from rainwater, soil,
		  litter, and streamwater during the mid- to late rainy
		  season in all 3 years of the study. P. ramorum was not
		  recovered from sporadic summer rains or soil and litter
		  during the hot, dry summer months. Concentrations of
		  inoculum in rainwater varied significantly from year to
		  year and increased as the rainy season progressed for the
		  two complete seasons that were studied. Potential dispersal
		  distances were investigated for rainwater, soil, and
		  streamwater. In rainwater, inoculum moved 5 and 10 m from
		  the inoculum source. For soil, transmission of inoculum was
		  demonstrated from infested soil to bay laurel green leaf
		  litter, and from bay laurel green leaf litter to aerial
		  leaves of bay laurel seedlings. One-third to one-half of
		  the hikers tested at the study site during the rainy season
		  also were carrying infested soil on their shoes. In
		  streamwater, P. ramorum was recovered from an unforested
		  site in pasture ≈1 km downstream of forest with inoculum
		  sources. In total, these studies provide details on the
		  production and spread of P. ramorum inoculum in
		  mixed-evergreen forest to aid forecasting and managing dis-
		  ease transmission of this environmentally destructive

  abstract	= {California bay laurel trees (Umbellularia californica)
		  play a crucial role in the reproduction and survival of
		  Phytophthora ramorum in coastal California forests by
		  supporting sporulation during the rainy season and by
		  providing a means for the pathogen to survive the dry,
		  Mediterranean summer. While bay laurel is thus critical to
		  the epidemiology of sudden oak death and other P. ramorum
		  diseases in California, the relatively minor symptoms
		  observed on this reservoir host suggest that it may not
		  sustain ecologically significant injury itself. The
		  long-term role that P. ramorum will play in California
		  forests will depend in part on the extent to which this
		  pathogen decreases the ecological fitness of bay laurel.
		  Despite the importance of this question, no study has yet
		  investigated in detail the physiological impact that
		  ramorum blight imposes on bay laurel. This experimental
		  study quantifies the impact that P. ramorum has on
		  artificially inoculated bay laurel seedlings with
		  measurements that integrate the full injury that infection
		  with an oomycete may cause: photosynthetic efficiency,
		  total photosynthetic area, and growth. Leaf area and leaf
		  mass were not impacted significantly by infection of P.
		  ramorum. Photosynthetic efficiency was mildly depressed in
		  symptomatic, but not asymptomatic leaves, despite
		  unnaturally high levels of necrosis that were imposed on
		  the seedlings. These results demonstrate that bay laurel
		  trees suffer only minor injury from ramorum blight beyond
		  visible necrotic symptoms. Consequently, it is highly
		  likely that bay laurel will continue to be widely available
		  as a host for P. ramorum in California forests, which has
		  long-term implications for the composition of these
		  forests.},

  abstract	= {Many biologists use population models that are spatial,
		  stochastic and individual based. Analytical methods that
		  describe the behaviour of these models approximately are
		  attracting increasing interest as an alternative to
		  expensive computer simulation. The methods can be employed
		  for both prediction and fitting models to data. Recent work
		  has extended existing (mean field) methods with the aim of
		  accounting for the development of spatial correlations. A
		  common feature is the use of closure approximations for
		  truncating the set of evolution equations for summary
		  statistics. We investigate an analytical approach for
		  spatial and stochastic models where individuals interact
		  according to a generic function of their distance; this
		  extends previous methods for lattice models with
		  interactions between close neighbours, such as the pair
		  approximation. Our study also complements work by Bolker
		  and Pacala (BP) [Theor. Pop. Biol. 52 (1997) 179; Am.
		  Naturalist 153 (1999) 575]: it treats individuals as being
		  spatially discrete (defined on a lattice) rather than as a
		  continuous mass distribution; it tests the accuracy of
		  different closure approximations over parameter space,
		  including the additive moment closure (MC) used by BP and
		  the Kirkwood approximation. The study is done in the
		  context of an susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic
		  model with primary infection and with secondary infection
		  represented by power-law interactions. MC is numerically
		  unstable or inaccurate in parameter regions with low
		  primary infection (or density-independent birth rates). A
		  modified Kirkwood approximation gives stable and generally
		  accurate transient and long-term solutions; we argue it can
		  be applied to lattice and to continuous-space models as a
		  substitute for MC. We derive a generalisation of the basic
		  reproduction ratio, R0, for spatial models.},

		  the interacting processes of infection and demography.
		  Reproduction and development can replenish the pool of
		  susceptible hosts, and demographic structure leads to
		  heterogeneous transmission and disease risk. Epidemics, in
		  turn, can increase mortality or reduce fertility of the
		  host population. Here we present a framework that
		  integrates both demography and epidemiology in models for
		  stage-structured epidemics. We use the vec-permutation
		  matrix approach to classify individuals jointly by their
		  demographic stage and infection status. We describe
		  demographic and epidemic processes as alternating in time
		  with a periodic matrix model. The application of matrix
		  calculus to this framework allows for the calculation of R0
		  and sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract	= {We show how a recent framework combining Markov chain
		  Monte Carlo (MCMC) with particle filters (PFMCMC) may be
		  used to estimate population state-space models. With the
		  purpose of utilizing the strengths of each method, PFMCMC
		  explores hidden states by particle filters, while process
		  and observation parameters are estimated using an MCMC
		  algorithm. PFMCMC is exemplified by analyzing time series
		  data on a red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) population in New
		  South Wales, Australia, using MCMC over model parameters
		  based on an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We fit
		  three population models to these data; a density-dependent
		  logistic diffusion model with environmental variance, an
		  unregulated stochastic exponential growth model, and a
		  random-walk model. Bayes factors and posterior model
		  probabilities show that there is little support for density
		  dependence and that the random-walk model is the most
		  parsimonious model. The particle filter Metropolis-Hastings
		  algorithm is a brute-force method that may be used to fit a
		  range of complex population models. Implementation is
		  straightforward and less involved than standard MCMC for
		  many models, and marginal densities for model selection can
		  be obtained with little additional effort. The cost is
		  mainly computational, resulting in long running times that
		  may be improved by parallelizing the algorithm.},

		  the within-patch parasite basic reproductive number which
		  characterises the infection dynamics at the local spatial
		  scale; and the neighbourhood of interaction which describes
		  which patches interact with which and the strength of
		  coupling between patches within the neighbourhood which
		  together characterise the spread of the parasite over
